    "## Part 1: The Approach\n",
    "To answer this question, it must first be determined what London should be compared *to*. Of course, there are many possible approaches, each yielding varying answers. The method I thought was most interesting was to compare London to cities spread across the globe. A convenient way to do this would be to compare London to the other capital cities of the world; this would ensure a widely dispersed set of data while including many of the most populous cities (e.g., Paris, Tokyo, etc.). I would then, based on the data (see Part 2), define a \"Raininess Index\" (see Part 3) to easily compare the raininess of London to other world capitals and create meaningful visualizations of these analyses."

The [OpenMeteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) provided the weather data, given the latitude and longitude of cities.\n",

    "The country-capital-lat-long-population CSV was found on [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/ofou/df09a6834a8421b4f376c875194915c9). This contains much of the same data as the World Cities CSV, but only includes the capital cities of each country. This made it easier to iterate through when requesting data from the OpenMeteo API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenMeteo API is a free API providing the historical and forecast weather data used in creating the raininess index; however, the API does have a rate limit. This is addressed in Part 3. Both historical and forecast weather data were collected for each capital city. Historical data included the past two years of daily rain sum (mm of rain per day) and hours of precipitation. The forecast data included the projected next 7 days of rain sum (mm of rain per day)."

    "London (the red dashed line) falls to the left of the peak of the density distribution. This is a PDF (probability density function), so the area under the curve to the right of the red line represents the cities that are rainier than London, while the area to the left are cities with a raininess index less than or equal to London. Since London is positioned somewhat left of the peak but still within the main cluster, this suggests that a fair portion of cities are rainier than London. However, given the left-skew of London's position relative to the distribution, it's likely that a significant percentage of cities are also less rainy.\n",

    "This analysis provides insights into London's raininess relative to other global cities by examining historical rainfall data and a custom-defined raininess index. Through comparative visualizations, it appears that London exhibits moderate rainfall levels with some seasonal fluctuations, placing it neither among the wettest nor the driest cities within this selection. However, it’s essential to note that these results are heavily influenced by the specific parameters chosen to define the raininess index. Different definitions or thresholds for rain events, intensity, or frequency could yield a different perspective on London's relative position. As such, the conclusions drawn here should be understood within the context of these chosen metrics. Further exploration with adjusted parameters or additional climatic factors could offer a more nuanced understanding of London's precipitation patterns in a global context."
