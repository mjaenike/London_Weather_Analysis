This repository attempts to determine whether London's reputation as an ever-gray, rainy city accurately reflects its weather patterns.

## How to run the code
The code and its testing are most well documented in the Jupyter Notebook ***[link here]***. There is also a .py file ***[link here]*** for the functions that were imported into the Jupyter Notebook ***[link here]***. The testing of these functions is also included in the .py file ***[link here]***.

To run the code, libraries must be installed in the terminal as follows:
>>> pip install <library>

These libraries include pandas, lets_plot, and geopandas.

## References and Sources
The Wikipedia page entitled ["List of countries by average annual precipitation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_annual_precipitation) was used in the creation of the raininess index to very that results reflected one of the metrics used in the calculation of the index (mm of rainfall)

Additionally, much of the knowledge of Python and some packages (namely, datetime, math, and time) was derived from previous coursework.
